# Rock Paper Scissors
This is an assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) and my first project with JavaScript. 
 Player will have fun with a computer which randomly chooses rock, paper or scissors. After 5 winning matches, the winner will be alerted. 
 Its purpose helps me put HTML/CSS and JavaScript together.
